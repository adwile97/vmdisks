This repository may include VM disks (.vdi or .vhd primarily), bootable ISOs, snapshots, OVA and OVF files.
Any sources will get credited if they are not directly me or the contributer, ISOs used for the installation of VMs may get included in the folders.

I will NOT include any activated Windows VM setups purposefully.

This repository is made to be a reliable source for VM setups of some OSes that take some time to install in a VM.
Contributors are very welcome to add their own VMs:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Look for the category folder your OS should belong in. If it isn't a Linux distribution, Windows OS or any other type of distribution that is standalone or it doesn't fit in the same category (like Windows bootlegs), make a new category folder or a subdirectory (e.g. Windows/non-MS or bootleg).
3. Make a directory with the name of the OS or distribution if it doesn't exist already.
4. Make a directory inside the OS-specific folder. Name it after yourself/your username or anything else able to seperate your setup from potential or existing others. If it is your second setup for the OS in this repository, destinguish it from your other(s) by renaming both and adding a feature that is different between the setups (e.g. disk size, VM program used, architecture, disk file type)
5. Upload the files (favourably as many as possible) that can be used to set up the OS. Ensure that all of them are functional. Examples:
Disk image, OVA and/or OVF, direct ZIP/RAR/similar of the VM folder, ISOs, files used in installation, snapshots.
6. Make a text file including neccesary information:
MANDATORY: Root password, all users and passwords, VM software used/if a VM was used, credits (yourself, link to source of installation disk ISO if apparent, any other credits)
OPTIONAL/CASE-SPECIFIC: controllers setup, info about snapshots (if not given in the name), other considerations, CPU architecture, VM settings, modifications to the computer after installation.
7. Submit a pull request.

Go to the discussion page to talk about the repository and make requests for OSes to be added by others, or the issues page to report any problems.
